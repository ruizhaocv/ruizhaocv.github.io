I work at Netease [Fuxi AI Lab](https://fuxi.163.com/fuxi-introduction) as an AI researcher. My research interests 
include computer vision, multimodal and their applications in video games 
and remote sensing. I received my B.S. and M.S. degree from Image Processing Center of Beihang University, 
in 2019 and 2022 supervised by Prof. [Zhenwei Shi](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/), 
also working closely with Prof. [Zhengxia Zou](https://zhengxiazou.github.io/).
