I'm an AI researcher at Netease [Fuxi AI Lab](https://fuxi.163.com/fuxi-introduction). 
I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Image Processing Center of Beihang University, supervised by Prof. [Zhenwei Shi](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/), also working closely with Prof. [Zhengxia Zou](https://zhengxiazou.github.io/).
My current research interests lie in multimodal and AIGC, including text-driven video generation and avatar generation.
