# About Me
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of Prof. [Mike Shou](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab). 
Previously, I was a full-time AI researcher at Netease [Fuxi AI Lab](https://fuxi.163.com/fuxi-introduction), working with Dr. [Lincheng Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NYLsVscAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 
I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Image Processing Center of Beihang University, supervised by Prof. [Zhenwei Shi](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/), also working closely with Prof. [Zhengxia Zou](https://zhengxiazou.github.io/).

My current research interests lie in multimodal and AIGC, including text-driven video generation and avatar generation.
