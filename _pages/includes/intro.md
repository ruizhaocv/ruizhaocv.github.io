I am currently a first-year (2023-now) Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of Prof. [Mike Shou](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab). 
Previously, I worked at Netease [Fuxi AI Lab](https://fuxi.163.com/fuxi-introduction) as an AI researcher. 
I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Image Processing Center of Beihang University, in 2019 and 2022 supervised by Prof. [Zhenwei Shi](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/), also working closely with Prof. [Zhengxia Zou](https://zhengxiazou.github.io/).
My current research interests lie in multimodal and AIGC, including text-driven video generation and avatar generation.
